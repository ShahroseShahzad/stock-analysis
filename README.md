# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 
 The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. This process was originally completed in a similar format, however, the goal for this round was to increase the efficiency of the original code.
### Results
Before refactoring the code, I began by copying the code that was needed to create the input box, chart headers, ticker array, and to activate the appropriate worksheet. The steps were then listed out in order to set the structure for the refactoring. Below is the instruction and code as written in the file.

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code 
Refactoring helps us to improve the internal structure of an existing source code, while maintaining its external behavior. 

Refactoring has many advantages that helps to make our code more organized and save time. 
Once refactoring has taken place, the code easier to understand and read, as well as easier to maintain. A cleaner code includes design and software improvement, debugging, and faster programming. It is also beneficial for other users who view our projects because it becomes easier to read, as the code is more concise and straightforward. If a code is not properly written and a lot of bugs are raised. Before fixing bugs code should be refactored. 


However, refactoring does have a few disadvantages. It can be a very time-consuming process and should not be done close to a deadline. The cost of refactoring is a lot higher than if the code was written from scratch. If you do not test the refactoring code and have enough time to fix it, it can introduce bugs causing more delays.


### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code in Original VS Refactored Script
One if the advantages of refactoring for me was a decrease in macro run time. The original analysis took approximately 0.156seconds whereas our new analysis only took about a four of the time (approximately 0.25 seconds) to run. Attached below are the screenshots that indicate the run time for our new analysis.
